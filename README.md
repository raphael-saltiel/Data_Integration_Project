# Data_Integration_Project
Projet de Data Integration ECE 2025

📊 Data Integration Project
📌 Description:
This project focuses on designing and implementing a Data Warehouse (DW) while exploring NoSQL technologies, particularly Neo4j, for managing and analyzing heterogeneous data. The main objective is to integrate, query, visualize, and analyze data using Big Data tools, leveraging OLAP methods and clustering algorithms.
📁 Project Structure:
The project is structured around the following files:
📄 Report – A document detailing the methodology, results, and analysis.
📂 data_original.csv – Raw data before any processing.
📜 data_processing.py – Python script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
📂 processed_data.csv – Cleaned and transformed data.
📂 matrix.csv – Data matrix used for analysis and visualization.
📜 data_integration_visualization.py – Script for visualizing the data and perform clustering using the k-means algorithm and visualize the clusters
🛠️ Technologies Used:
SQL – Data Warehouse design and querying.
Neo4j & Cypher – NoSQL data management and graph analysis.
Python:
Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib – Trend visualization.
Scikit-learn – Clustering algorithms (k-means).
🔧 Running the Project:
1️⃣ Clean and preprocess the data
python data_processing.py
2️⃣ Analyze and visualize data
streamlit run data_integration_visualization.py
